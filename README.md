 Welcome to the SEG Program! Here's how it works:

    1. **Login**:
       - The program requires you to login with the username and password.
       - If you do not see the password, don't worry. It uses the same system like in Linux, so you can't see it, but it's beeing typed.
       - You'll have 3 attempts to enter the correct credentials, then the program will shut off.

    2. **Shared Password for Encryption**:
       - After logging in, you'll be prompted to enter a shared password. This password is used for encrypting and decrypting messages and files.
       - The shared password is verified before any encryption can happen.
       - The password should be the same across all users for successful encryption/decryption.

    3. **Main Menu**:
       - After logging in and setting up encryption, you'll see the main menu where you can:
         [1] Encode Message: Encrypt a message using the shared password.
         [2] Decode Message: Decrypt an encoded message using a shared password.
         [3] Clear Console: Clears the screen + logo.
         [4] Messages: Access the messaging system (both terminal-based and GUI-based).
         [5] File Encryption/Decryption: Encrypt or decrypt files using the shared password.
         [6] Help: Displays this help section.
         [7] Exit: Exit the program.

    4. **Messages**:
       - You can send and receive encrypted messages to/from other users with the same shared password.
       - To send a message, choose the recipient, the user, type the message and make sure the both of you(or more) have entered the same shared psw.
       - You can also check your inbox and delete messages.

    5. **File Encryption/Decryption**:
       - Encrypt and decrypt files by providing their file paths.
       - When encrypting a file, a `.enc` file will be created, and when decrypting, a `.dec` file will be generated. To take the file to its original state after decrypting,
         simply change the extension to what the file had before the encryption.

    * This program is made specificly for Windows.
    *General group chat has the shared password SEG. Enjoy.
    
    Enjoy using SEG Program! Keep your shared password safe and secure. Choose complex usernames, to not conflict with others. Theonly bad thing of your username conflicting with others, is that you will see in their chats, but not their messages,becouse they have another shared password.
